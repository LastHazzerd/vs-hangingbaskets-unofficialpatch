Note: This is a forked unofficial patch to the original creator's mod, it's last official update was on Vintage Story's 1.19 build,
I've updated it to 1.21 and haven't changed much beyond ensuring compatability with 1.21's changes.
I do not plan to add my own content to this patch. 

# Hanging Baskets - Original Dev notes.

A [VintageStory](https://www.vintagestory.at/) mod, that adds hanging baskets and flowerpots.

**[Original Mod](https://mods.vintagestory.at/hangingbaskets)**

Currenty this is only a content mod but I have some ideas that might change that in the future, so the repo kept like a code mod...
